Description: Fits Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (EGPD), Discrete
    EGPD (DEGPD), Zero-Inflated EGPD (ZIEGPD), and Zero-Inflated Discrete
    EGPD (ZIDEGPD) models within a GAM (Generalized Additive Model) framework,
    with additional support for fitting via 'gamlss' and 'bamlss'. The fitting
    infrastructure is adapted from the 'evgam' package by Ben Youngman.
    P-value testing code is adapted from the 'mgcv' package by Simon Wood.
    Models 1-6 are supported for each distribution family. References:
